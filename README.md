### Purpose
Book chooser App. This is a user focused book library with search and recmmendation tools to help users find books to read. This is achieved either via a search or recomendations based on the users personal book library. Users are able to create a uique profile with a personal library of books they have read, authors whose books they have read and genres that they enjoy. This information can then be compared to the broader library of books and a list of reccomended titles and/or authors can be given. Users can also ask for recommendations based on a single title. There is also a search function so the user can search the broader library for titles and authors.

### Functionality
Users are able to create a uique profile (byxyz) with a personal library of books they have read, authors whose books they have read and genres that they enjoy. This information can then be compared to the broader library of books and a list of reccomended titles and/or authors can be given. Users can also ask for recommendations based on a single title,(To do this we created classes of books, authors, genres and users) individual author or given genre. There is also a search function so the user can search the broader library for titles and authors searching the arrays of title, authors and genres within each class.
