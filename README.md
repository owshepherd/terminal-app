###Purpose
Book chooser App. This is a user focused book library with search and recmmendation tools to help users find books to read either via a search or recomendations based on the users personal book library.
###Functionality
Users are able to create a uique profile with a personal library of books they have read, authors whose books they have read and genres that they enjoy. This information can then be compared to the broader library of books and a list of reccomended titles and/or authors can be given. Users can also ask for recommendations based on a single title, individual author, given genre or keyword. There is also a search function so the user can search the broader library for titles, authors or return results by keyword or genre.
